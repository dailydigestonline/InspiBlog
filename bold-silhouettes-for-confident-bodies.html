          <p>
            For far too long, men’s underwear was reduced to bland
            basics—standard cuts, muted colors, and design choices that
            prioritized utility over expression. But fashion evolves. And today,
            a new wave of menswear is redefining what it means to feel seen,
            confident, and comfortable beneath it all.

            Confidence, Reimagined
          </h2>
          <p>
            Style doesn’t start with outerwear. It begins with the layer closest
            to your skin. At DealByEthan.shop, the philosophy is simple:
            confidence starts underneath. Whether you're slipping into something
            athletic, erotic, or everyday-casual, your underwear should support
            how you feel—not limit it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each pair is an opportunity to express a mood, an energy, a sense of
            self. The selection on DealByEthan.shop is engineered to move with
            you, offering support, structure, and self-assurance in every cut.
